Unit Test

with the unit test i took both the singular approach and multitesting approach 
to show the versitility of testing. I created 5 test cases based of the info given and
my assumptions based of user expierience.

Test1.java
Tests the straightforward scenario of entering a qualifying string and getting back the required grouped list.


Test2.java
Tests the formating of the string and the error that would be thrown if the string has any alpha characters.

Test3.java
Test the string to see if there are any none permitted separators. like i explained this could be put into individual
classes for all unknown separators or patterned with a regular expression.
 
Test4.Java
Removes multiple comma if there is user error that can be corrected by the program. It removes
Comma separators if there is no data separating them.

Test5.java
Tests for duplicate values as these values would range on there own and not group with the correct range I check for duplicates
and inform the user to check the specific data enter to remove the duplicates. Though with the algorithm it could be left to print as its own range.
